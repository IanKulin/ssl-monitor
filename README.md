# SSL Certificate Monitor

A lightweight application that monitors SSL certificate expiry dates and sends notifications when certificates are approaching expiration.

## What It Does

This tool helps prevent unexpected SSL certificate expirations by:
- **Automatically scanning**  websites for certificate expiry dates
- **Visual dashboard** to see all certificate status at a glance
- **Notifications** via email (Postmark) and push notifications (NTFY)
- **Relevant alerts** - only notifies when certificate status actually changes

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone or download the project
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ssl-monitor

# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d --build

# Access the web interface
open http://localhost:8080/results
```

The container includes default settings and is ready to use immediately. Configuration persists in the `./data` directory.

## Using the Application

### 1. Add Your Websites
Visit `http://localhost:8080/sites` to add websites you want to monitor. Just enter the domain name (e.g., `google.com`) - no need for `https://`.

### 2. Configure Notifications
Visit `http://localhost:8080/settings` to:
- Set warning/critical thresholds (e.g., warn at 30 days, critical at 7 days)
- Configure email notifications (requires Postmark account)
- Set up push notifications (via NTFY)
- Test your notification settings

### 3. Monitor Your Certificates
The dashboard at `http://localhost:8080/results` shows:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Certificate is healthy (plenty of time left)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Certificate needs attention (approaching expiration)
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Certificate expires very soon (action required immediately)

## How Notifications Work

1. **Unified Thresholds**: Set warning (e.g., 30 days) and critical (e.g., 7 days) thresholds
2. **Status Change Detection**: Only sends notifications when a certificate's status actually changes
3. **Per-Service Control**: Choose which services get warning vs critical alerts
4. **No Spam**: Sites at the same status don't generate repeat notifications
5. **Instant Updates**: Changing thresholds immediately updates all statuses

### Example Behavior
With thresholds set to warning: 30 days, critical: 7 days:

- **Site at 45 days**: ðŸŸ¢ Green "Good" - no notifications
- **Site drops to 25 days**: ðŸŸ¡ Yellow "Warning" - sends notification once
- **Site stays at 25 days**: No additional notifications
- **Site drops to 5 days**: ðŸ”´ Red "Critical" - sends urgent notification
- **Certificate renewed to 90 days**: ðŸŸ¢ Green "Good" - no notifications

## Notification Services

**Email (Postmark)**
- Requires a Postmark account and server token
- Sends HTML-formatted emails with certificate details
- Configure in Settings â†’ Email Notifications

**Push Notifications (NTFY)**
- Free service for instant mobile/desktop notifications
- Visit [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) to create a topic
- Configure in Settings â†’ NTFY Notifications

### File Organization Philosophy

Each Go file contains domain-specific logic with separate template files:
- `settings.go` + `settings-html.go`: Settings management and web interface
- `sites.go` + `sites-html.go`: Site CRUD operations and management interface
- `results.go` + `results-html.go`: Results display and dashboard interface
- `scans.go`: SSL certificate scanning logic
- `notifications.go`: Status change detection and notification orchestration
- `notify-send.go`: Service-specific notification delivery
- `main.go`: Application orchestration and HTTP routing

### Local Development

```bash
# Prerequisites: Go 1.21+ installed

# Run directly
go run *.go

# Or build and run
go build -o ssl-monitor
./ssl-monitor

# Access web interface
open http://localhost:8080/results
```

### Container Development

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f ssl-monitor

# Rebuild after code changes
docker-compose up -d --build
```

}

## How Notifications Work

The notification system uses a simple, predictable approach:

1. Dashboard color thresholds control both UI display and notification triggers
2. Notifications only sent when a site's status changes (normal â†’ warning â†’ critical)
3. Each notification service can be enabled/disabled for warning and critical levels independently
4. Sites at the same status level don't generate repeat notifications
5.  Changing threshold settings immediately updates notification status without re-scanning certificates

### Example Behavior

With thresholds `warning: 30, critical: 7`:

- **Site at 45 days**: Green "Good", no notifications
- **Site drops to 25 days**: Yellow "Warning", sends to services with `enabled_warning: true`
- **Site stays at 25 days**: No additional notifications (no status change)
- **Site drops to 5 days**: Red "Critical", sends to services with `enabled_critical: true`
- **Certificate renewed to 90 days**: Green "Good", no notifications (but history updated)
- **Threshold changed from 30â†’40**: Immediate notification if site status changes from normal to warning

## Web Interface

- **Dashboard/Results**: `/results` - View certificate status and scan results
- **Sites Management**: `/sites` - Add, edit, enable/disable sites
- **Settings**: `/settings` - Configure thresholds, notifications, and intervals
- **Test Endpoints**: `/test-email`, `/test-ntfy` - Verify notification configuration
- **Status**: `/status`- text status for external monitoring `okay`/`warning`/`critical`

## Roadmap

### Immediate Priorities
